=================
Model: Experiment
=================

In the Model folder we have a special set of methods, group under the
wide name: Experiment. In this folder we have new classes that
are specifically written to perform a complex experiment.

Every time we have to run an automatic experiment we write the
class that contains all the methods needed to set it up, run and save
the obtained data.

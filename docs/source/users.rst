If you just want to use some of the controllers to connect your computer
to your devices, this is the place to start.

First, make sure you are at the right conda env. In the readme we have instructions on
how to create it and to work on it you can run in a conda prompt:

    >>> activate hyperion

Then, to run the file scan.py in the experiment folder you you should do:

    >>> python hyperion/controller/base_controller.py

A nice place to start looking for examples in in the examples folder.

Testing
=======

In order to help and guide the developer we have created some
tests for the specific functionality of each level in the code.
The idea is that every time some code is developed, a test is also
written so it can be used to ensure the correct behaivour of the code.

We have some basic unit tests in the folder unit_tests. So far we
have the following tests
